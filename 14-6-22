202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

ans-class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(long long int n) {
       long long  int sum=0;
        if(n==1 || n==7){
            return true;
        }
        else if(n<10){
                return false;
            }
            
        while(n){
            int rem=n%10;
            sum=sum+(rem*rem);
            n=n/10;
        }
        return isHappy(sum);
    }
};
